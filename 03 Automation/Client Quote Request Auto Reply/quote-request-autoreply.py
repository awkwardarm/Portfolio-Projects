"""
Autoreplies project quote requests to potential clients who contact me on a third party online marketplace.
The marketplace times how long I take to respond to messages, so this script is designed to respond within a few minutes of receiving a message.
The script logs in to the marketplace, checks for new messages, and sends a pre-written response to quote requests.
The script runs continuously, checking for new messages every few seconds.

        """Thank you for reaching out. I'm away from my studio at the moment and I will personally respond as soon as I return.
               
Your best songs in my hands will reach their full potential. Together we can craft them into professionally polished records that resonate with your audience. Every step of the entire process (pre-production, track production, vocal production, mixing, and mastering) is under my umbrella. From demo to master there's no need to hire additional engineers, session players, or producers. I'm a master of the craft and I find no greater joy than evoking emotion out of the speakers.
               
If you don't need full production, I'll review and edit the quote.
               
Lastly, please send me a link to your most effective songs, I'd love to hear your best work.
               
I look forward to listening and connecting,
