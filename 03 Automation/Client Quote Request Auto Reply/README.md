The script `quote-request-autoreply.py` automates project quote requests to potential clients who contact me through my profile on a third party online marketplace. The marketplace penalizes my profile's search ranking if I take too long to respond. This script aleviates tedious administration and optimizes my ranking by generating proposals within a few minutes of receiving a client request.
